# Given n buildings on a 2D plane, find the skyline of these buildings. 
# Each building on the 2D plane has a start coordinate, end coordinate, and height. 
# The skyline is defined as a unique representation of rectangular 
# strips of different heights which are created after the overlap of 
# multiple buildings in the 2D plane. Refer this image for clarity, 
# on the left are multiple buildings and on the right is the skyline for the same.
# The output skyline is sorted on the x coordinate of the rectangular strip.
