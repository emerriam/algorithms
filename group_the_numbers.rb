# Complete the solve function below.

# You are given an array of non-negative integers only. 
# Group them in-place into evens and odds in such a way that all evens appear on the
#  left side and all odds on the right side.

# Input Format:
# 	0 <= element <= 10^9
# 	Integer array
# 	Repeats possible.

# Output Format:
# 	Return the same integer array, with evens on left side and odds on the right side. 
# 	There is no need to preserve order within odds or within evens.

# Constraints:
# 	1 <= n <= 10^5
# 	Given array may contain duplicate numbers.
# 	Solutions with linear time complexity and constant auxiliary space is expected.

def solve(arr)


end

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]


# [4, 2, 1, 3]

# Explanation:
# Order does not matter. Other valid solutions are
# [2, 4, 1, 3]
# [2, 4, 3, 1]
# [4, 2, 3, 1]
