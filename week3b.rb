# Height Of K-Ary Tree

# Problem Statement:
# Given a k-ary tree containing N nodes. You have to find height of the tree. (Length of the longest path from root to any node.)
# (We are looking for number of edges on longest path from root to any node, not number of nodes on longest path from root to any node.)
# Input Format:
# There is only one argument denoting the root of the k-ary tree. 
# Output Format:
# Return an integer denoting height of the k-ary tree.
# Constraints:

# 1 <= N <= 10^5
# 0 <= k <= N - 1
# Total there are 30 test cases, out of which 1 test case (test case no. 28) is a 
    # degenerate tree (pathological tree) of size 10^5. Due to recursion limit, 
    # some languages like javascript and python might not pass it, 
    # so don't worry about that. But if you are using C++ or Java then it is expected to pass it.  
# Sample Test Case:

# Sample Input:

# 3-ary tree:
# 1 is the root of the tree.
# 2's parent is 1.
# 3's parent is 1.
# 5's parent is 1.
# 4's parent is 5.

# Sample Output:
# 2

# Explanation:

# Given a 3-ary tree with 5 nodes. Node 1 has 3 children 2, 3 and 5, and node 5 has one child 4.
# Longest path from root is 1 -> 5 -> 4 and it's length is 2.

# Notes:
# Total there are 30 test cases, out of which 1 test case (test case no. 027) is a 
    # degenerate tree (pathological tree) of size 10^5. Due to recursion limit, 
    # some languages like JavaScript, Ruby, Python etc. might not pass it, 
    # so don't worry about that. But if you are using C++ or Java then it is expected to pass it.
