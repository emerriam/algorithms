# Complete the findZeroSum function below.

# Given an array of N integers, find all triplets that sum to 0 (zero).
# 	Triplets may or may not be consecutive numbers.
# 	The array can include duplicate elements.
# 	Array is not necessarily sorted.
# 	Print output as shown. i.e. as strings, one per line, comma separated elements. See sample for clarity.
# 	Order of elements inside the answer triplets does not matter. i.e. if your output elements are the same, 
# 	but only in different order, then it's an acceptable solution.
# 	Do not print duplicate triplets. Eg: 1,1,-2 and 1,-2,1 are duplicates.
# 	If no such triplets are found, then print nothing.

# Input Format:
# 	Integer array
# 	Input may or may not be sorted
# 	Repeats possible

# Output Format:
# 	Return a String array containing all possible triplets who sum to 0. One String for one triplet.
# 	Order of output does not matter. 

# Constraints:
# 	1 <= N <= 2000
# 	-10^3 <= element <= 10^3
# 	Given array may contains duplicate numbers.
